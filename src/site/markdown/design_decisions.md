### Cash register functionality

#### Task specification

The goal of the final task in the subject 'Configuration Management' 
is / was to implement a so called 'Registrierkasse' 
(in our implementation it is called `CashRegisterManagement`). 
This cash register should be able 
to sell custom created `Drink` products and store information 
about the sale itself (`timestamp`, `price`, `Drink` and `Operator`).  

The actual selling process is of great importance, 
but equally important is analyzing and assessing the state of current sale figures.
Because of that, different kind of reports are required, to achieve 
this goal and therefore manage the business in a successful manner.

**Following reports were requested by THE customer  
(*total income = gross total income*)**:  
1. Total income per non-alcoholic beverages  
2. Total income per weak-alcoholic beverages  
3. Total income per intense-alcoholic beverages  
4. Total income for a specific day  
5. Total income generated by a specific `Operator`  
6. Total income for a specific day, generated by a concrete `Operator`  

#### Implementation details

All `DrinkSale`s with their corresponding metadata are stored 
within a history, which is persisted in an administrative class (`CashRegisterManagement`).
Next to a history typical timestamp, 
the `DrinkSale` data class holds information about the responsible `Operator`, 
the specific `Drink` and `price` included in the sale.

**Note**: The class diagram above does not include the entire project scope. 
It focuses on the cash register functionality.

From now on the abstract `Drink` class implements the `IDrinkSpecification` interface.
We do this because every `ConcreteDrink` should implement the defined `calculatePrice` method in their own way. 
Alternatively, we could have declared the method head or an implementation in the abstract class itself.
However, we would act against a requirement of the task.
Therefore, and for diversification purposes we let all 
child classes implement the price calculation method.

As every `ConcreteDrink` uses its own implementation of the `calculatePrice` method, 
the actual retrieval process of the price is also different throughout the various realisations.  
However, most `ConcreteDrink`s compute the price based on the amount of `Liquid`s, 
the general alcohol percentage and volume included in the individual beverage.  
Like in real world conditions extras within a beverage are more expensive (e.g. sweetener, sugar, etc.). 
Therefore, the calculation may additionally vary based on this fact.

Last but not least, there is another positive effect worth to mention. 
As we calculate and store the price during the sale creation process, 
we will always know the actual retail price.
Even when the calculation method changes over time, 
the history will not be affected and therefore the 
general principal of a history is not violated (immutability).
